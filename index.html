            <p>The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to filmmaking to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were nominated for Academy Awards with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion and is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[3][4</p>

                Character History: Little is known about Darth Bane as much of his backstory has been classified as part of the Legends of the old Extended Universe. What is known is that he was a member of an elite group of Sith known as the Brotherhood of Darkness. Back when there were as many Sith as Jedi, Bane observed that the Sith would frequently betray each other and often fall to chaos.

                Character History: Almost no history is currently available for Darth Plagueis. Darth Sidious does reveal that Plagueis was a master of using the force to extend his lifespan, which may explain Sidious' apparent longevity.

                Character History: Sheev Palpatine was born on the planet Naboo approximately 84 years before the Battle of Yavin. Palpatine got involved in politics at a relatively young age and quickly became a Senator representing the planet in the Galatic Senate. Some time in this window he was apprenticed by Darth Plagueis in the way of the Dark Side of the Force. Palpatine would kill his master at some point prior to Episode I and take on Darth Maul as an apprentice. He is considered to be the most powerful Sith Lord in many centuries.
